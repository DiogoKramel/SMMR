# About SMMR

**SMMR** (Simulation of Marine Mammals Resilience) is a JavaScript-based online application designed to evaluate the impacts of anthropogenic activities on marine mammals species. **SMMR**  implements several routines in order to estimate how a certain population might oscillate in a given time span. 

## Key features

- Implement analysis with standard data based on literature and input your own
- Adjust the anthropogenic threats to your study case
- Simulation loops elimante the randomness of the answer
